## Overview & Planning

I created a James Bond themed Tic-Tac-Toe game.

I first tackled the game logic.  I felt that having a strong foundation to build on was important.
I wanted the game to work first and then attach it to the database. I tried to break down the game into smaller problems, and deal with them individually. I created a game board first, then put Xs and Os to make sure the game works. Next I assigned it values and made sure everything worked locally. Then deployed it to make sure that was working. After everything worked, I then designed it with James Bond images.
